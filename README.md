# RÃ–STIMARKT



## Goal
A trading platform, where _vendors_ use _inters_ as selling points, and _consumers_ buy directly to _vendors_, while subscribing to a _inter_, used as delivery point.

The _consumers_ subscribe to a geographically close _inter_, and order items. If a condition( minimum quantity at deadline) is met, the deal is closed, and the _vendors_ delivers to the _inter_. Else, deal is cancelled.

Items are made available according to the _vendors_' stock. 
A commission is paid both to the site owner and the _inter_.


In addition to that, _vendors_ should be able to use that platform as well to monitor their own stock, and eventually to initiate trades. Trades will be completed offline, but the platform should provide a way for each to tell if they have overflow in a certain type of item.

## Specs
